Planning is a big part of user testing because it sets you up for success. If possible, kick off the process with a team meeting to decide and document the: what, why, how, who, how many, how long, and where of user testing.  

**WHAT:** Deciding what to test depends on your team’s agreed upon roadmap. If a user testing phase is <span style="background-color:#FFF972">already built-in to your development process</span>, you can skip this step. But if you’d like to do a user test and you don’t know what to test (kudos to you!), there are a number of options. 


Ideas for what to test with users:
<ol>
<li>New features </li>
<li>Known pain-points or bugs </li>
<li>Something you’re curious about</li>
</ol>
