# Synthesis for open source

# Introduction

### **What is synthesis?**

Synthesis is a stage of research in which you reorganize information to make sense of what you observed and heard.

### **Why do synthesis?**

Synthesis helps teams and individuals understand what users experience when they use the tool, including their challenges and successes. This can then help OSS maintainers, developers, designers, product managers, and researchers arrive at user-informed conclusions about the product, and from there, make decisions based on the lived experience of the users.

### **What is the outcome?**

The information you’ll be working with is raw user ‘data’ (typically qualitative but sometimes quantitative) and making it understandable within the context of your product to produce ‘insights’.

### **What about open source specifically?**

Synthesis can be applied similarly to both Open Source Software and non-open source software. Being open with your process, understanding, discussion and findings is at the heart of OSS. The ability for OSS to include a variety of stakeholders in synthesis is one of OSS’s superpowers - just be clear with your limitations on time and facilitation. Before testing and synthesis, it’s worth clarifying **who your user is.** Are you focusing on ‘end users’ (e.g. users that don’t modify or contribute back)? Or are your users also contributors?

### **Keep in mind…**

Remember, no technology is perfect and can be improved by learning about how users actually use it. Every technology has problems, you’re not alone.

## What is ‘synthesis’ not?

There’s an idea that user testing means putting an individual user (or group of users) in charge of your decision making - but it doesn’t! During a test, if a user says, “Oh you should have functionality that does exactly this thing I’ll explain” it doesn’t mean that you are bound to build it. Instead, you just learned that the user is looking for a solution that your tool doesn’t offer or in the way they expect. It’s less about the exact requested specifications and more about analyzing their problem (alongside other users’ problems) to land on an achievable, inclusive solution. Remember, synthesis is an opportunity to hear your users’ voices and experiences, understand their needs, and use that insight to inform the design and development process and ‘back up’ choices.

>A story from working on user research on OSS tools:
>I once was a designer/researcher on an open source tool that helps sellers manage inventory. During a user test, one user said, “What I really want is to speak into my mobile phone and have the inventory update immediately - oh and I don’t get internet connection in my stock room so it has to work offline”.
Oh no! The team was thinking: “We now have to build an intelligent system to automatically reduce stock based on voice commands and save those via a recording system and...” 
Before the team went too far down this onerous (and perhaps unnecessary) path, I asked them: “What basic-level concern is the user expressing when they speak about a magical automated inventory voice command system?” We thought about this during several more user tests and discussions. 
As we learned more about our users, we discovered that a huge concern for them was inventory errors and the negative impact on customers. That meant our team focused on the basic issues of accurate stock checking and verification systems, and not ‘offline voice AI’. As a result, everytime we worked on the tool’s inventory admin area, we remembered how important error prevention was and worked to make small, achievable (non-magical) improvements to make our users happy.
