# Synthesis for open source

# Introduction

### **What is synthesis?**

Synthesis is a stage of research in which you reorganize information to make sense of what you observed and heard.

### **Why do synthesis?**

Synthesis helps teams and individuals understand what users experience when they use the tool, including their challenges and successes. This can then help OSS maintainers, developers, designers, product managers, and researchers arrive at user-informed conclusions about the product, and from there, make decisions based on the lived experience of the users.

### **What is the outcome?**

The information you’ll be working with is raw user ‘data’ (typically qualitative but sometimes quantitative) and making it understandable within the context of your product to produce ‘insights’.

### **What about open source specifically?**

Synthesis can be applied similarly to both Open Source Software and non-open source software. Being open with your process, understanding, discussion and findings is at the heart of OSS. The ability for OSS to include a variety of stakeholders in synthesis is one of OSS’s superpowers - just be clear with your limitations on time and facilitation. Before testing and synthesis, it’s worth clarifying **who your user is.** Are you focusing on ‘end users’ (e.g. users that don’t modify or contribute back)? Or are your users also contributors?

### **Keep in mind…**

Remember, no technology is perfect and can be improved by learning about how users actually use it. Every technology has problems, you’re not alone.

## What is ‘synthesis’ not?

There’s an idea that user testing means putting an individual user (or group of users) in charge of your decision making - but it doesn’t! During a test, if a user says, “Oh you should have functionality that does exactly this thing I’ll explain” it doesn’t mean that you are bound to build it. Instead, you just learned that the user is looking for a solution that your tool doesn’t offer or in the way they expect. It’s less about the exact requested specifications and more about analyzing their problem (alongside other users’ problems) to land on an achievable, inclusive solution. Remember, synthesis is an opportunity to hear your users’ voices and experiences, understand their needs, and use that insight to inform the design and development process and ‘back up’ choices.

>A story from working on user research on OSS tools:
>I once was a designer/researcher on an open source tool that helps sellers manage inventory. During a user test, one user said, “What I really want is to speak into my mobile phone and have the inventory update immediately - oh and I don’t get internet connection in my stock room so it has to work offline”.
Oh no! The team was thinking: “We now have to build an intelligent system to automatically reduce stock based on voice commands and save those via a recording system and...” 
Before the team went too far down this onerous (and perhaps unnecessary) path, I asked them: “What basic-level concern is the user expressing when they speak about a magical automated inventory voice command system?” We thought about this during several more user tests and discussions. 
As we learned more about our users, we discovered that a huge concern for them was inventory errors and the negative impact on customers. That meant our team focused on the basic issues of accurate stock checking and verification systems, and not ‘offline voice AI’. As a result, everytime we worked on the tool’s inventory admin area, we remembered how important error prevention was and worked to make small, achievable (non-magical) improvements to make our users happy.

## Summary:

Through a synthesis process, you can:

- **LEARN**: Gain understanding and clarity by hearing users’ voices and experiences.
- **SHARE**: Turn individual knowledge into group knowledge through storytelling and conversation.
- **FOCUS**: Move in a direction that is informed by user data.
- **APPLY**: Use the findings to make the software/tool better.

Finally, the goal is ***not*** to act on what any single user requests, but to use that information to discover root-level problems and achievable solutions.

# Logistics

### **Start ASAP**

So that all the important stories, actions, and comments are still fresh in your mind, it’s best to do some synthesis as soon as possible. We recommend that you briefly capture and organize notes right after the test (if not immediately, hopefully within 48 hours). Then work on the cumulative synthesis once all user tests are completed (within 2 weeks).

After each test, the facilitators and observers can fill out a [debrief template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lw8Bu0mjSWn5ej1fSyDFXi-xnDMixUfYt-1Ddbm1siA/edit) (individually or through group discussion). This helps everyone think about all aspects of the user test, not just about what the users said and did, but any body language, inferred meaning and interpretations.

### **Make it a party**

Ideally, 2-4 people with diverse roles and experiences participate in synthesis. This helps speed up the process, collect different perspectives, and get buy-in for decisions. Here’s a short, non-exhaustive list of stakeholders you might want to include:

- As many of the people that were present during the user testing or research as available.
- A few additional people who are familiar with the goals and aims of the research.
- 1-2 people who have no context of the research but are affected by or interested in the outcomes.
- People responsible for the OSS technical aspects as well as the community, product, design and wider roles.
- A facilitator to guide the discussion and ensure processes are followed and time is not spent on diversion topics.

*Tip: If you have more than 4 people be sure to give clear and specific roles and guidance for participation. With more than 10 people synthesis becomes difficult and actually takes longer.*

*Tip: If there are people participating in synthesis that were not present during the user tests, ask them to read any notes, watch, or listen to any recordings and review the goals of the user testing/research and synthesis ahead of time.*

### **What about open source specifically?**

When including diverse OSS stakeholders, the group can easily become quite large. Alternatively, you can appoint a single ‘representative’ of each part of your OSS. People will have different time capacities and access to a synthesis process, so it’s important to make realistic requests of volunteer contributors and be aware that some may need help understanding the purpose of synthesis. Be clear about your expectations for their role, e.g. “You should watch or listen to a recording or read the user testing notes if you haven’t attended a user test session. Keep your comments on insights about users.”

### **Setting up the collaborative workspace**

It’s important to work synchronously, either together in a room or an online call. As always, without seeing your collaborators' faces it can be hard to communicate complex and inferred information. In addition to video/audio, you will need a space where you’ll write together and then read together is vitally important. If you’re working face to face, you can write on sticky notes and stick them on a wall. If you’re working virtually, there are whiteboard tools like Miro.com, Mural.com, Google Jamboard, or even Google Sheets. There are also open source virtual whiteboards, but they are less user friendly than the commercial proprietary tools. PenPot is the most user friendly OSS tool that we currently know of. Whichever tool you use, each person’s sticky notes should be visible to and moveable by everyone.

*Tip: In-line text tools like Google Docs and collaborative writing programs don’t offer a good way to move notes freely on a canvas, and therefore we don’t recommend using those for synthesis (though it can be done if you are persistent!).*

Here’s how you might set up your in-person or virtual space:

# How to do ‘synthesis’

There are a few ways to do synthesis, but for this resource we’re going to focus on a simple method that we use regularly.

### **Introduce the process**

Remind the group of the goal for user testing. This goal statement could be in a format like: ‘We want to find out how users do X with Y in order to understand how Z is done.’
Example: ‘*We want to find out how users deploy a new instance of our OSS using limited technical infrastructure in order to understand how users create work-arounds and read documentation’.*

Establish any communication guidelines. A hard part of synthesis can be simply having time and space to hear everyone's understanding of the research data. We recommend assigning roles in the discussion. One person can have multiple roles if need be.
- A facilitator ensures you’re following the synthesis process broadly, guiding conversation, and referring to the goals of the synthesis and user research.
- A time-keeper ensures you’re moving along and sets timers if necessary.
- A documentarian ensures that whatever is being said is being documented either by the individual speaking or themselves. They should keep asking themselves, “Is this being written down?”
- An advocate pays attention to who is and is not speaking and ensures that no one person is taking up a majority of the time so that everyone has a chance to speak.

### **Write down raw user data**

The synthesis process starts by getting all the user data together. Put each problem, comment, insight or observation a separate sticky note. The data will be rearranged, so it’s important that each statement has its own sticky note. Statements should be a maximum of 10 words if possible.

You can:

1. Copy/paste short statements from longer notes documents (such as a debrief worksheet).
2. Rewrite statements from notes documents.
3. Recall statements from memory and write them down.

*Optional: Tag your sticky notes with relevant criteria such as participant number, geographical location, device type, or anything else that’s important to your OSS tool. This is helpful to see if any patterns emerge based on specific attributes. E.g. Every Mac user wasn’t able to complete the checkout process.*

>A story from working on user research in OSS tools:
For one project, we did qualitative (interviews) and quantitative research (survey) with various types of users. Unfortunately, after the synthesis was done we realized that we made a critical error in our survey - one question was not specific to the part of the tool we were focusing on. This meant that some of our sticky notes were giving us a false impression. We’d have to go back to the raw data and analyze which product the respondents were referring to. Luckily we had tagged each sticky note with the source and alias of the person. This made it easy to target the data points in question and remove the ones that were not part of our research goal. While we still kept that data, it was important to keep the focus targeted - we couldn’t synthesize both parts at the same time!. We needed to keep it manageable for our sanity and time constraints. Another thing we did on this project was to color code the sticky notes: green for positive insights, yellow for neutral insights, and red for negative insights. At the end it was helpful to see the hotspots of positive and negative areas to get a vision of what areas needed the most improvement.
